<p><span class="smcap">G. Willis</span> gratefully acknowledges the various interesting
documents and letters he has received. He is anxious
that it should be perfectly understood that he is not the
author of any statement, representation, or opinion, that
may appear in his "Current Notes," which are merely selections
from communications made to him in the course of
his business, and which appear to him to merit attention.
Every statement therefore is open to correction or discussion,
and the writers of the several paragraphs should be
considered as alone responsible for their assertions. Although
many notes have hitherto appeared anonymously,
or with initial letters, yet wherever a serious contradiction
is involved, G. Willis trusts that his Correspondents will
feel the necessity of allowing him to make use of their
names when properly required.</p>

Etymology for a further elucidation of this singular coin,
and the Semi-Jewish tribe whose name it bears.</p>

<p>Felatah.&mdash;Hebrew &#1508;&#1500;&#1496; <i>phalat</i>, which by comparison
with its cognates signifies, <i>to separate from</i>, <i>retire into</i>,

or <i>Felatah</i>, signifying <i>evasio</i>, <i>liberatio</i>, <i>residuum</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Cithara.&mdash;Greek &#954;&#953;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#945;. Hebrew and Chaldee &#1495;&#1496;&#1512;
<i>chatar</i>, <i>a stick</i>, (plectrum), <i>to beat with a stick</i>; therefore
the instrument cannot be the &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512; <i>asor</i>, <i>decachordon</i>;

<h2>ARCHÆOLOGICAL PUBLICATIONS.</h2>


<p><i>In compliance with the wish very generally expressed
by G. W.'s Subscribers and Correspondents, particularly
by S. E. ("Current Notes" for March, p. 22,) G. W.
has collected the titles of the chief Archæological publications
in England, and in France and Germany. The
former he believes to be nearly correct, but the latter is
necessarily very imperfect, with the exception of the
North of France. Very few foreign Antiquarian publications
find their way to this country, as reference to the
libraries of the British Museum and the Society of
Antiquaries will prove.</i></p>

<small>AFTER THE MANNER OF THE OLD CONTINENTAL BALLAD<br />
WRITERS, BY GEORGE P. MORRIS, ESQ.</small><br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Once on a time old Johnny Bull,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flew in a raging fury,</span><br />
And swore that Jonathan should have<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No trials, sir, by jury:</span><br />
That no elections should be held,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Across the briny waters:</span><br />
"And now," says he, "I'll tax the tea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of all his sons and daughters,"</span><br />
Then down he sat in burly state,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And blustered like a grandee,</span><br />
And in derision made a tune<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Called "Yankee Doodle dandy."</span><br />
"Yankee Doodle"&mdash;these are facts&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yankee doodle dandy:</span><br />
"My son of wax, your tea I'll tax&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yankee doodle dandy."</span><br />
<br />
John sent the tea from o'er the sea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With heavy duties rated;</span><br />
But whether hyson or bohea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I never heard it stated.</span><br />
Then Jonathan to pout began&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He laid a strong embargo&mdash;</span><br />
"I'll drink no tea, by Jove!" so he<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Threw overboard the cargo.</span><br />
Then Johnny sent a regiment,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Big words and looks to bandy,</span><br />
Whose martial band, when near the land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Play'd "Yankee doodle dandy."</span><br />
"Yankee doodle&mdash;keep it up!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yankee doodle dandy!</span><br />
"I'll poison with a tax your cup,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yankee doodle dandy."</span><br />
<br />
A long war then they had, in which<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">John was at last defeated&mdash;</span><br />
And "Yankee doodle" was the march<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To which his troops retreated.</span><br />
Cute Jonathan, to see them fly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could not restrain his laughter:</span><br />
"That tune," says he, "suits to a T,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll sing it ever after."</span><br />
Old Johnny's face, to his disgrace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was flushed with beer and brandy,</span><br />
E'en while he swore to sing no more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This "Yankee doodle dandy."</span><br />
"Yankee doodle&mdash;ho! ha! he!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yankee doodle dandy&mdash;</span><br />
"We kept the tune, but not the tea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yankee doodle dandy."</span><br />
<br />
I've told you now the origin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of this most lively ditty,</span><br />
Which Johnny Bull dislikes as "dull<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And stupid!"&mdash;what a pity!</span><br />
With "Hail Columbia!" it is sung,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In chorus full and hearty&mdash;</span><br />
On land and main, we breathe the strain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">John made for his tea-party.</span><br />
No matter how we rhyme the words,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The music speaks them handy,</span><br />
And where's the fair can't sing the air,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of "Yankee doodle dandy!"</span><br />
"Yankee doodle&mdash;firm and true&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Yankee doodle dandy&mdash;</span><br />

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Mahon and General Greene and La
Fayette.</span>&mdash;C. F. D. presents his compliments to Mr.
Willis, and with reference to the fifth paragraph headed
"Scraps from the United States," which appeared in
"Current Notes" for February last, p. 13, forwards him
the following communication, which from the initials he
presumes is from the pen of Mr. Hildreth, the historian:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The fifth and sixth volumes of Lord Mahon's History
of England from the peace of Utrecht, have for a leading
subject the early years of the American Revolutionary War.
Writing from the English point of view, the proceedings
of Parliament and the English side of the story naturally
form the foreground of the picture, while the affairs of the
colonies themselves&mdash;certainly the most interesting as well
as the most important, not for Americans only, but for all
historical students&mdash;fall into a distant perspective. The
American part of Lord Mahon's book is very slight in its
execution, made up mostly of anecdotes and extracts of
letters, good as illustrations, but hardly as substance; indicating
often but a superficial knowledge on the part of
the writer, and conveying to the reader no distinct or connected
idea of the American side of the story. With a
great show of candour, 'My Lord' also evinces throughout
a somewhat anxious desire to depreciate the 'rebels.'
Thus Franklin is pursued with pitiful but persevering rancour,
charged with falsehood and duplicity, because he, like
most of the other Americans of that day, arrived at the
point of separation and independence only by gradual
steps; because his opinions and views of 1769 and 1775
did not correspond altogether with those of 1795; and
because he appears to have spoken&mdash;as what was more
natural?&mdash;with somewhat more of freedom and with greater
dislike of the British connexion among his intimate associates
than when addressing himself to the British ministry
or to British statesmen.</p>

<p>A curious instance of this sort of spitefulness, which constantly
exhibits itself throughout the book, occurs in the
case of Gen. Greene, of whom Lord Mahon writes: "The
command of this important post (Brooklyn) was entrusted by
Washington to Gen. Greene, an officer of bravery and enterprise,
'<i>but of intemperate habits</i>;' and he adds, in a note,
'<i>Greene, un général souvent ivre</i>.' These are the words
of La Fayette; Mém. et Corresp. Vol. I. p. 21, ed. 1837."
The edition in the original French here quoted is not at
hand, but in that published the same year at New York
and London, in England, and like the French edition under
authority of La Fayette's representatives, the entire passage
above referred to, reads as follows: After an account
of the appearance of the American army as first seen by
La Fayette in the summer of 1777&mdash;about 11,000 men, ill
armed, and still worse clothed, and very deficient in tactics,
La Fayette adds: 'Lord Stirling, more courageous than
judicious, <i>another General who was often intoxicated</i>, and
Greene, whose talents were only then known to his intimate
friends, commanded as Major Generals.' The other
General here referred to was Stephen, who was cashiered not
long after on that very ground, for his misbehaviour at the
Battle of Germantown. And as there can scarcely be a doubt
that this version gives the correct sense of the French original,
there is room for apprehension that Lord Mahon is
not only incorrect in giving only a part of a sentence, thus
putting into La Fayette's mouth what he never said, but
that even the order of the words has been changed, the
name of Greene being removed from the end to the beginning
of the quotation. Upon this point I will add something
further, so soon as I can obtain the French original."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sale of Antiquities</span>, &amp;c. which took place at
Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson's rooms, on the 5th of
this month, and two following days, although one made
up by the dealers in such articles, attracted considerable
attention, and many things, if not bought in, realised
considerable prices; the total produce of the sale being,
it is said, upwards of twelve hundred pounds.</p>

</div>
<p>In the first and third day's sale several lots of articles,
well known to Archæologists as Celts, and of which
the usual appearance
may
be recognised
from figures 1
and 2, sold on
the average for
about half-a-crown
each. A
large quantity
of antique gems&mdash;none
of any
extraordinary
merit&mdash;in modern
setting of
gold, ranged
from about ten
shillings to two
guineas each.
There were
some specimens
of Irish ring
money, which
sold or were
bought in at
very high prices; and some appeared to have been
tampered with, if not manufactured for the market.</p>


<p>The second day's sale contained many good Etruscan
and Roman bronzes. A Winged Victory (Lot 222) was
knocked down at £5. A Lamp with the original chain
for suspension (Lot 238) at £5. 8<i>s</i>. An Etruscan stew-pan
(Lot 256) at £5. 10<i>s</i>. And the Leg of a Roman
Warrior, the foot sandalled (Lot 234) at £7. 7<i>s</i>. But
the great object of the day was (Lot 266) a bronze figure
of an Archer, which was stated to have been discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in July, 1842, while excavating for making a sewer in
Queen Street, Cheapside, London, and which, if standing
erect, would have been fifteen inches, but in its stooping
posture the perpendicular height was about eleven
inches. It has been described and figured in the
Archæologia, vol. xxx. plate xxii. p. 544.</p>

<p>This really fine work of art was put up at 30 guineas,
and, after a slight struggle, knocked down to Purnell
B. Purnell, Esq., of Stancombe Park, Dursley, Gloucestershire
for 125. The Etruscan fictile vases sold for about
as many shillings as forty years ago they would have
brought pounds, but the miscellaneous articles brought
extraordinarily high prices. Two Necklaces of common
Venetian beads (Lots 351 and 357) worth about half-a-crown
each, were eagerly contended for, and the hammer
fell at £2. 6<i>s</i>. The second day's sale closed with a
struggle for various gold Etruscan fibulæ and ornaments,
which went at high prices, and it was understood
in the room that an Etruscan gold necklace, with
a head of Medusa attached, was bought in at no less a
sum than £50.</p>

<p>The third day's sale was less attractive. An exceedingly
curious Lamp in bronze (Lot 470), of oval form,
with four burners issuing from the sides, the handle
formed of figures of grotesque animals, and stated to
have been found near London Bridge, produced four
guineas. There were a few (eight) illuminated Manuscripts,
but none sold for extravagant prices. An
Etruscan gold wreath, composed of masks and foliage
worn round the helmet, from the Canino Collection
(Lot 529) was secured by T. Crofton Croker, Esq., for
£19. 10<i>s</i>. With the disposal of some Shaksperian
relics this very miscellaneous sale closed, but they did
not appear to be much coveted.</p>

<p>There were some fine and many desirable specimens,
with a few of very doubtful character, and some unquestionable
forgeries. The Earl Cadogan, Sir Gardiner
Wilkinson, Dr. Henderson, and other amateurs of Art
and Archæology, seemed to watch the progress of the
sale with considerable interest.</p>

<div class='right'>

March 28th, 1852.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Your Correspondent, H. M. will find a very
curious history of the origin and formation of the Union
Jack in Brayley's "Graphic Illustrator:" it is written
by the late Sir Harris Nicolas, and the "absurd arrangement"
of the National Flag elucidated by nine
heraldic woodcuts.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will permit me to embrace this opportunity
of saying a few words on the abstraction of
Monumental Brasses from churches, which has attracted
the attention of some of your Correspondents lately;
one of whom throws the blame almost wholly on "the
sectarian soldiers of Cromwell's time."<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> I am not
desirous of defending these men, but I <i>am</i> desirous that
modern Churchwardens should not screen their neglect
by such an excuse. A slight research among our topographical
works will prove, that a very large abstraction
and destruction of such memorials has taken place in
comparatively recent times. In the introduction to
Cotman's "Brasses of Norfolk and Suffolk," he notes
that "in 1800 the chancel of Ingham was completely
swept of all its beautiful memorials of the Stapleton
family. They were sold as old metal, and it was commonly
reported by whom they were bought and sold;
but nobody sought to recover them; neither minister
nor churchwarden cared for any of these things." The
beautiful brass (engraved in this same work) of Robert
Attelath, Mayor of Lynn in 1374, was about forty years
ago "given out of the church by the Churchwardens to
a person who sold it for five shillings to a brass founder."
The collection of rubbings from Brasses made about the
same time and bequeathed to the British Museum by the
late Francis Douce, present several since destroyed.
The Journal of the Archæological Association narrates
the fact of several removed from a country church because
their rivets became loose, and "tripped up the
old women who came to the fore seats in the aisle." I
remember several instances of Brasses thus loosened,
taken up and thrown in vestries or belfries, until they
were sufficiently forgotten to be carried out and sold to
the metal-founder. Some few Antiquaries have argued
that they are better taken care of in their museums
than thus exposed to destruction; and churchwardens
being willing "to get rid of the ugly old things," many
have disappeared this way. Let me, however, record
one instance of honourable restitution. The effigy of
an armed knight, of the Bacon family, (temp. Edw. I.)
in Gorleston Church, Suffolk, engraved by Cotman, "in
1810 was gone, and supposed to be irretrievably lost;
but at the sale of Mr. Craven Ord's curiosities, it was
purchased by John Gage, Esq., who, with correct feeling
and good taste, gave it back to the church, and Dawson
Turner, Esq., at his expense, had it replaced in its
original position." Surely, the soldiers of Cromwell
have sins enough to answer for, without heaping those
of modern Churchwardens on their heads.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;-As this famous Portrait seems to be an
object of interest to several of your subscribers, I take
the liberty of adding my mite of information concerning
it. In the March Number of "Current Notes," p. 21,
it is stated that Caulfield valued a good impression of it
at £36, but your Correspondent remarks, that "this
was all very well for a dealer's valuation," adding, that
the one sold at the Strawberry Hill sale was bought by
a printseller for £7. 15<i>s</i>. That Caulfield was nearly right
in his appreciation, I find confirmed by reference to the
Catalogue of the 'extensive and choice collection of
Prints' formed by my uncle, the late Robert Morse, Esq.
of Clarges Street, Piccadilly, which was sold by auction
by the well-known Dodd, May 15th, 1816, and 27 following

"an excellent impression and of the utmost rarity,"
sold for £30 19<i>s</i> 6<i>d</i>. This, it is true, was in the high

<h2><span class="smcap">Tokens of the Seventeenth Century.</span></h2>


<p>The notice of Tradesmen's tokens, inserted in the
"Current Notes" of Feb. 25th, has attracted more
attention than I expected, as besides the letters published
in the Notes of March 25th, I have had direct
communications from Andover and Downpatrick. In
reply to the obliging letter of "K. L." Dublin, I beg to
say, that I had seen the engraving of the Cork farthing
in Mr. Lindsay's work, but as I did not sufficiently express
my meaning, I will now explain what I meant by
"<i>the Commonwealth Arms</i>," viz. that the two shields
of Arms of England and Ireland were side by side, as
shewn on the Token engraved in the "Notes," and precisely
in the form they appear on the Coins of the Commonwealth,
not separate as on the Cork farthing, one
shield on the obverse, the other on the reverse side.
They are all scarce: I do not know a single example
of these Arms on an English token. Dr. Smith's Catalogue
of Irish Tokens was unknown to me; I shall take
the first opportunity to procure a copy.</p>

<p>My chief object in writing the notice was to get any
information concerning the Tokens of Scotland, whether
there are any besides the Royal tokens. The Scotch
tokens of the 18th Century, mentioned by your correspondent
"M. A. M." are well known, and engraved in
the excellent work by Charles Pye, on the "Provincial
Coins and Tokens issued from the year 1787 to 1801,
Birmingham, 1801."</p>

<p>The following passage from Thoresby, the Leeds historian,
who was a celebrated Numismatist in his day, gives
the best information I can find on the subject: he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When private persons first obtained liberty of
having their own names inscribed on the Tokens, I cannot
learn. Sir William Dick had that favour in Charles
I.'s time, but that was in Scotland. It seems to have
been otherwise in England. I have by me a copy of an
order in Council, whereby it appears that only the
King's farthing tokens should be current here,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> and the
privilege of coining them was granted to the Duke of
Lennox, and the Marquis of Hamilton, under the Great
Seal."</p>

<p>The passage is obscure, and does not sufficiently give
the information wanted, as the great bulk of these
tokens were issued during the time of the Commonwealth
and the reign of Charles II.</p>

<p>The study of Tradesmen's tokens has met with such
unmerited contempt from some of our ablest antiquaries,
that it seems rash to attempt an apology for them; but
any one who is well acquainted with them knows the
fund of amusement and instruction that may be derived
from them, and if they continue to be slighted as they
have been, many specimens will be irretrievably lost to
future antiquaries. A few further remarks on them
may be interesting to your general readers.</p>

<p>After a careful calculation, I cannot estimate the
number of these tokens at less than 40,000, and I think
that number less than the real quantity; from various
correspondence with collectors, I always find that they
have a large number different to mine. Mr. Akerman
has described 2461 in his list of London Tokens only.
The great loss to the public compelled the Government
to put them down under the severest penalties: very
large numbers may be picked out of a collection, which
would require a dozen to weigh a modern halfpenny;
their paltry intrinsic value, no doubt, prompted many
unprincipled shopkeepers to issue them, from the profit
they derived from the quantity which would be lost,
owing to their small size. There is scarcely a village
that had not its local currency. I possess tokens of 684
cities, towns, and villages.</p>

<p>Amongst the different trades and professions which
appear on the tokens, that of a Musician is seldom met
with: the following is an interesting example, and
furnishes an early example of Punch&mdash;</p>

<p>Henry Laude, Newark, says, "Noe want where these
are." The cruel sport of cock fighting is on the token
of William Docker, of Leeds, drawer. Gateshead has
a punning coat of arms&mdash;a goat's head: to the lovers of
Heraldry there is a fund of amusement; besides the
Arms of the Trading Companies of London, we have the
Arms of Corporations, and families. Many of the Corporations
issued their tokens: Wotton-under-Edge has,
"This farthing token will be owned by the Mayor and
Aldermen." The Bristol Corporation farthing is of good
size and execution: many different dies were used. It
is an exceedingly common token, and remarkable, as
being the only one issued in that important commercial
town. Many names of towns appear on these tokens,
which would puzzle a gazetteer to find out: two names
occur to me at this moment, <span class="smcap">Ozed</span> and <span class="smcap">Fairefax</span>.</p>

<p>To those who are interested in Tokens, I would recommend
the "Reliquiæ Antiquæ Eboracenses, or Remains
of Antiquities in Yorkshire," which can be supplied
by you: two numbers are published, each containing a
plate of Yorkshire Tokens.</p>
